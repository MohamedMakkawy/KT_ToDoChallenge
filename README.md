#The project based on Java, Selenium , Maven & Testng
#Used design patter POM
#Two test suites included one has the positive tests and one for the negative scenarios
#You can run any specific test direct as testng or you can run all at once
#testng.xml not included but it can be added to control running the tests
#Browser was chrome v103
#Each test has comment before to describe what is the purpose of the test
#Tests are independent so you can run any test at any time or run all in any order
#For reporting I used default report of testng you can find it under test output with name emailable-report.html. 

Notes
Tried to add more negative scenarios for the limits but I was able to create to do items with 6045 characters without issues
also, I was able to add 123 items to the list without issues
